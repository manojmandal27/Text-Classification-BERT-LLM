# Text-Classification-BERT-LLM


Problem Statement
Intent identification using BERT model

Learning Objectives
At the end of the mini-project, you will be able to :

Read the intent, questions and responses data
Load a pre trained BERT model
Fine-tune the BERT model
Get the predictions for each question
Overview
The intent identification problem is framed as a text classification task, where a BERT model is trained to classify intent. Once the model is fine-tuned, a conversation tool is set up. For each user question, the model first predicts the intent, and a response is selected from a predefined set of responses corresponding to the predicted intent as the answer to the input question.
